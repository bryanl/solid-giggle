## Summary

CustomResources store arbitrary JSON data without following the typical Kubernetes API  behaviour to prune unknown fields. This makes CRDs different, but also leads to security and general data consistency concerns because it is unclear what is actually stored in etcd. 

This KEP proposes to add pruning of all fields which are not specified in the OpenAPI validation schemas given in the CRD. 

Pruning will be opt-in in v1beta1 of `apiextensions.k8s.io` via

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
spec:
  preserveUnknownFields: false
  ...
```

i.e. CRDs created in v1beta1 default to disabled pruning. 

**Pruning will be enabled for every CRD created in v1** and we will hide `preserveUnknownFields` in v1 in that case.

Pruning can be disabled for subtrees of CustomResources by setting the `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` vendor extension. This allows to store arbitrary JSON or RawExtensions. This will even be possible at the root level, even in v1. Adding that in every to each object in a schema leads to the old behaviour.

Pruning requires _structural schemas_ (as described in [KEP Vanilla OpenAPI Subset: Structural Schema](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1002)) for all defined versions. Validation will reject the CRD with `preserveUnknownFields: false` otherwise.

## Motivation

* Native Golang based resources do pruning as a consequence of the JSON unmarshalling algorithm. This is has become a fundamental behaviour of Kubernetes API semantics that CustomResources break.
* Pruning enforces consistency of data stored in etcd. Objects cannot suddenly render unaccessible because unexpected data breaks decoding.
* Even if unexpected data in etcd is of the right type and does not break decoding, it has not gone through validation, and probably an admission webhook either does not exist for many CRDs or it won't have implemented pruning behaviour. Pruning at the decoding step enforces this (scenario: applying a new CR instance with new fields against a cluster with an old CRD manifest).
* Pruning is a counter-measure to security attacks which make use of knowledge of future versions of APIs with new security relevant fields. Without pruning an attacker can prepare CustomResources with privileged fields set. On version upgrade of the cluster, these fields can suddenly become alive and lead to unallowed behaviour.

### Goals

* Prune unknown fields from CustomResources silently to match native type behaviour. Unknown means not specified in the OpenAPI validation spec.
* Allow to opt-out of pruning via the OpenAPI validation spec for a whole subtree of  JSON objects.

### Non-Goals
* Add a strict mode to the REST API which rejects objects with unknown fields.

## Proposal

We assume the CRD has _structural schemas_ (as defined in [KEP Vanilla OpenAPI Subset: Structural Schema](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1002)).

We propose to

1. derive the value-validation-less variant of the structural schema (trivial by definition of _structural schema_) and 
2. recursively follow the given CustomResource instance and the structural schema, removing fields from the former if they are not specified in the `properties` of the latter. Skip field removal in that recursion step (not for children) if `additionalProperties` is defined in the schema.
3. return a deserialization error if the CustomResource instance JSON value and the type in the structural schema do not match
4. fields of `metav1.TypeMeta` (`apiVersion` and `kind`) and `metav1.ObjectMeta` at the object root are implicitly specified. `metav1.ObjectMeta` is always pruned.

Note that in (2) `additionalProperties: <any-schema>` stops field removal on that level. This includes `additionalProperties: false`, compare examples (4) and (5).

We do this in the serializer just after the binary payload has been unmarshalled into an `map[string]interface{}` for the request body and when reading from etcd, compare the yellow boxes in the following figure:

![Decoding steps which must prune](20180731-crd-pruning-decoding.png)

We will also prune after mutating webhooks have been run.

### Excluding values from Pruning

There are cases where parts of an object are verbatim JSON, i.e. without any applied schema and especially without a complete specification which allows to apply pruning.

The vendor extension `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` proposed in (as defined in the [KEP Vanilla OpenAPI Subset: Structural Schema](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1002)) serves exactly this purpose, with the following semantics:

The whole JSON subtree `X` at the level of `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` and below is excluded from pruning, with the following exceptions:
1. pruning starts again at `Y` in the subtree of children of `X` if `Y` is specified by `properties`.
2. pruning starts again in the `metadata` child of `Y` in the subtree of `X` if `Y` is specified by `x-kubernetes-embedded-resource: true`. 

We do not allow `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: false`.

Note that (1) does not apply if `X` and  `Y` are the same, compare examples (7) and (8) below.

### Examples

1. unspecified

   ```yaml
   type: object
   ```
   
   Everything is pruned, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "json": {"bar": 43}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {}
   ```
   
2. `properties` at top-level

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     foo:
       type: object
   ```
   
   Everything other than `foo` is pruned, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "abc": 42
     },
     "json": {"bar": 43}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": {}
   }
   ```

3. `properties` at multiple levels

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     foo:
       type: object
       properties:
         bar:
           type: object
   ```
   
   Everything other than `foo` and `bar` is pruned, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "bar": {
         "abc": 42
       },
       "def": 43
     },
     "json": {"ghi": 44}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "bar": {}
     }
   }
   ```
   
4. `additionalProperties` with a non-empty schema

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     foo:
       type: object
       additionalProperties:
         type: object
   ```
   
   Everything directly inside of `foo` stays (it is considered a string map), but
   objects further down are pruned again because they are unspecified, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "abc": {"x": 42},
       "def": {"y": 43}
     },
     "json": {"ghi": 44}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "abc": {},
       "def": {}
     }
   }
   ```

5. `additionalProperties: false`

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     foo:
       type: object
       additionalProperties: false
   ```
   
   Everything directly inside of `foo` stays (it is considered a string map), but
   objects further down are pruned again because they are unspecified, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "abc": {"x": 42},
       "def": {"y": 43}
     },
     "json": {"ghi": 44}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": {
       "abc": {},
       "def": {}
     }
   }
   ```
   but validation will fail. We consider the semantical meaning of `false`  as value validation, not structural.
   
6. arbitrary JSON

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     json:
       x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
       nullable: true
   ```

   Inside of `.json` nothing is pruned, i.e.
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "json": {"bar": 43}
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
      "json": {"bar": 43}
   }
   ```
   
7. JSON, but with properties at the same level

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     json:
       type: object
       x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
       nullable: true
       properties:
         bar:
           type: object
   ```

   Inside of `.json` nothing is pruned, including everything in `bar`, i.e.
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "json": {
       "bar": {
         "abc": 43
       },
       "def": 44
     }
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
      "json": {
        "bar": {
          "abc": 43
        },
        "def": 44
      }
   }
   ```
   
8. JSON, but with properties at the same **and lower** levels

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     json:
       type: object
       x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
       nullable: true
       properties:
         bar:
           type: object
           properties:
             inner:
               type: integer
   ```

   The `properties` for `bar` "resets" pruning to normal behaviour, i.e.
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "json": {
       "bar": {
         "inner":43,
         "abc": 44
       },
       "def": 45
     }
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
      "json": {
        "bar": {
          "inner": 43
        },
        "def": 45
      }
   }
   ```
   
9. `additionalProperties` within JSON

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     json:
       type: object
       x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
       nullable: true
       additionalProperties:
         type: object
   ```

   The `additionalProperties` disables pruning **at its level**, `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` already has the same effect. Inside of the additional properties `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` keeps being effective, i.e.
   
   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "json": {
       "bar": {
         "inner":43,
         "abc": 44
       },
       "def": 45
     }
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "json": {
       "bar": {
         "inner":43,
         "abc": 44
       },
       "def": 45
     }
   }
   ```   
10. embedded resource

   ```yaml
   type: object
   properties:
     object:
       type: object
       nullable: true
       x-kubernetes-embedded-resource: true
       x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
   ```
   
   Here, inside of `.object` nothing is pruned with the exception of unknown fields under `.object.metadata`, i.e.

   ```json
   {
     "foo": 42,
     "object": {
       "bar": 43,
       "abc": 44,
       "metadata": {
         "name": "example",
         "garbage": 45
       }
     }
   }
   ```
      
   is pruned to
      
   ```json
   {
      "object": {
        "bar": 43,
        "abc": 44,
        "metadata": {
          "name": "example"
        }
      }
   }
   ```
 
11. implicit `metav1.TypeMeta` and `metav1.ObjectMeta`

   ```yaml
   type: object
   ```

   Pruning takes place, but `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata` and known fields under `metadata` are preserved, i.e.
   
   ```json
   {
     "apiVersion": "example/v1",
     "kind": "Foo",
     "metadata": {
       "name": "example",
       "garbage": 43
     },
     "foo": 42
   }
   ```
   
   is pruned to
   
   ```json
   {
     "apiVersion": "example/v1",
     "kind": "Foo",
     "metadata": {
       "name": "example"
     }
   }
   ```

### Opt-in and Opt-out of Pruning on CRD Level

We will add a `preserveUnknownFields` flag to `CustomResourceDefinitionSpec` of `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` (and later v1):

```go
type CustomResourceDefinitionSpec struct {
  ...
	
  // PreserveUnknownFields disables pruning of object fields which are not
  // specified in the OpenAPI schema. apiVersion, kind, metadata and known
  // fields inside metadata are excluded from pruning.
  // Defaults to true in v1beta1, and will default to false in v1. 
  // Setting this field to false is considered an beta API.
  PreserveUnknownFields *bool
}
```

I.e. for `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` this will default to true for backwards compatibility.

For `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` we will change the default to false and forbid true during creation and updates if it has been false before. In v1 the only way to opt-out from pruning is via setting `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` in the schema.

We will hide `preserveUnknownFields` in v1 objects if it is not true.

When CRD authors switch on pruning for an existing CRD, they are supposed to make their users trigger a data migration of existing objects in etcd, be it via an external migration mechanism, an operator rewriting all objects or manual procedures.

* Old pruning implementation PR https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64558, to be adapted 
* [OpenAPI v3 specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md)
* [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)

### Test Plan

**blockers for alpha:**

We default `preserveUnknownFields` to true and hence switch off the whole code path doing pruning. This reduces risk for everybody not using this feature.

* we add unit tests for the general pruning algorithm
* we add apiextensions-apiserver integration tests to
  * verify that the pruning feature is actually off if `preserveUnknownFields` is true.
  * verify that `preserveUnknownFields` is defaulted to true.
  * verify that pruning happens if `preserveUnknownFields` is false, for all versions in the CRD according to the schema of the respective version.
  * verify that `metadata`, `apiVersion`, `kind` are preserved if `preserveUnknownFields` is false and there is no schema given in the CRD.
  
**blockers for beta:**

* we implement and verify that `x-kubernetes-embedded-resource` and `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` work as expected.
* we add apiextensions-apiserver integration tests to
  * verify that pruning happens on incoming request payloads, on read from storage and after calling mutating admission webhooks.

**blockers for GA:**

* we verified that performance of pruning is adequate and not considerably reducing throughput.

### Graduation Criteria

* the test plan is fully implemented for the respective quality level

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

We aim at implementing this feature right away as beta:

* in order to get users' exposure to the feature with real CustomResourceDefinitions
* because the API surface is tiny such that we don't expect change in that area
* the pruning algorithm is simple enough that we feel confident with thourough test coverage that the risk is small.

Hence, we assume to be at beta in 1.15 and GA in 1.16 guided by the graduation criteria, leading the following upgrade/downgrade strategy:

* setting `preserveUnknownFields` to false is considered beta quality in 1.15.
* downgrading to 1.14 will lose `preserveUnknownFields: false`, but that's acceptable for beta.
* downgrading from 1.16 (where pruning might be GA) to 1.15 will keep the same behaviour as we don't feature gate `preserveUnknownFields: false`.
* upgrading from 1.14 will default to `preserveUnknownFields: true` and hence changes no behaviour.
* upgrading from 1.15 will keep the value and hence change no behaviour.
* when v1 of `apiextensions.k8s.io` is added, we will keep the old pruning behaviour for CRDs created in v1beta1 with `preserveUnknownFields: true`, but forbid `preserveUnknownFields: true` for every newly create v1 CRD. Hence, we keep backwards compatibility. 
  
  Technically, it is still possible to get the old behaviour even in v1 by setting `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` at the root level and in each `properties` statement. But we enforce the definition of a schema, at least with this minimal contents.

### Version Skew Strategy

* kubectl is not aware of pruning in relevant way
* posting `preserveUnknownFields: false` beta quality CRDs to an old server will disable pruning. But that's acceptable.

## Alternatives Considered

* in [GDoc which preceded this KEP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rBn6SZM7NsWxzBN41J2kO2Odf07PeGPygatM_1RwofY/edit#heading=h.4qdisqud6z3t) we considered a number of alternatives, including using a skeleton schema approach. We decided against that because of its complex semantics. In contrast, the _structural schema_ of the [KEP Vanilla OpenAPI Subset: Structural Schema](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1002) is the natural output of schema generators deriving a schema from Golang structs. This matches the behavior of pruning through JSON unmarshalling, independently of any value validation the developer adds on top.
* we could allow nested `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: false`, i.e. to switch on pruning again for a subtree. This might encourage non-Kubernetes-like API types. It is unclear whether there are use-cases we want to support which need this. We can add this in the future.
* we could allow per-version opt-in/out of pruning via `preserveUnknownFields` in `CustomResourceDefinitionVersion`. For the goal of data consistency and security a CRD with semi-enabled pruning does not make much sense. The main reason to not enable pruning will probably be the lack of a complete structural schema. If this is added for one version, it should be possible for all other versions as well as it is less a technical, but a CRD development life-cycle question.
* we intensively considered avoiding a new `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` vendor extension in favor of recursive `additionalProperties` semantics. We decided against because:
  
  None of OpenAPI v3 schema constructs have effects recursively. We would conflict with that pattern.
    
    E.g. `additionalProperties: false` invalidates unknown fields only at its level in OpenAPI v3, for example:
    ```yaml
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    properties:
      foo: {}
    ```
    (note: this is not allowed in CRDs, but in OpenAPI v3) forbids `{"foo":{},"abc":42}`, but not `{"foo":{"abc":42}}`. A recursive interpretation for pruning would diverge from this pattern.
    
    Another example:
    ```yaml
    additionalProperties:
      minimum: 42
    ```
    forbids `{"foo":10}`, but not `{"foo":{"bar":10}}`.
    
* we stop pruning even for `additionalProperties: false` or any other additional properties schema. We considered to prune for `false`, but not for `true`. We decided against because:
  
  * it is unclear what should happen with pruning for non-empty schemas between `false` and `true`.
  * it is infeasible to compute whether an arbitrary schema is empty (and hence equivalent to `false`) or not. Semantically empty schemas and `false` should behave the same behaviour. This includes pruning.
  
  By not pruning for any explicit value of `additionalProperties` (including `false`) we follow our principle of not trying to consider full semantics of OpenAPI including value validation when doing structural operations like pruning.
  
  Compare example (5): CustomResource validation will eventually forbid unpruned values. The semantical meaning of the schema `false` is considered non-structural and therefore not relevant for pruning.
