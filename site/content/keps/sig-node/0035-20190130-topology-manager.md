# Overview

An increasing number of systems leverage a combination of CPUs and
hardware accelerators to support latency-critical execution and
high-throughput parallel computation. These include workloads in fields
such as telecommunications, scientific computing, machine learning,
financial services and data analytics. Such hybrid systems comprise a
high performance environment.

In order to extract the best performance, optimizations related to CPU
isolation and memory and device locality are required. However, in
Kubernetes, these optimizations are handled by a disjoint set of
components.

This proposal provides a mechanism to coordinate fine-grained hardware
resource assignments for different components in Kubernetes.

# Motivation

Multiple components in the Kubelet make decisions about system
topology-related assignments:

- CPU manager
  - The CPU manager makes decisions about the set of CPUs a container is
allowed to run on. The only implemented policy as of v1.8 is the static
one, which does not change assignments for the lifetime of a container.
- Device manager
  - The device manager makes concrete device assignments to satisfy
container resource requirements. Generally devices are attached to one
peripheral interconnect. If the device manager and the CPU manager are
misaligned, all communication between the CPU and the device can incur
an additional hop over the processor interconnect fabric.
- Container Network Interface (CNI)
  - NICs including SR-IOV Virtual Functions have affinity to one socket,
with measurable performance ramifications.

*Related Issues:*

- [Hardware topology awareness at node level (including NUMA)][k8s-issue-49964]
- [Discover nodes with NUMA architecture][nfd-issue-84]
- [Support VF interrupt binding to specified CPU][sriov-issue-10]
- [Proposal: CPU Affinity and NUMA Topology Awareness][proposal-affinity]

Note that all of these concerns pertain only to multi-socket systems. Correct
behavior requires that the kernel receive accurate topology information from
the underlying hardware (typically via the SLIT table). See section 5.2.16
and 5.2.17 of the
[ACPI Specification](http://www.acpi.info/DOWNLOADS/ACPIspec50.pdf) for more
information.

## Goals

- Arbitrate preferred socket affinity for containers based on input from
  CPU manager and Device Manager.
- Provide an internal interface and pattern to integrate additional
  topology-aware Kubelet components.

## Non-Goals

- _Inter-device connectivity:_ Decide device assignments based on direct
  device interconnects. This issue can be separated from socket
  locality. Inter-device topology can be considered entirely within the
  scope of the Device Manager, after which it can emit possible
  socket affinities. The policy to reach that decision can start simple
  and iterate to include support for arbitrary inter-device graphs.
- _HugePages:_ This proposal assumes that pre-allocated HugePages are
  spread among the available memory nodes in the system. We further assume
  the operating system provides best-effort local page allocation for
  containers (as long as sufficient HugePages are free on the local memory
  node.
- _CNI:_ Changing the Container Networking Interface is out of scope for
  this proposal. However, this design should be extensible enough to
  accommodate network interface locality if the CNI adds support in the
  future. This limitation is potentially mitigated by the possibility to
  use the device plugin API as a stopgap solution for specialized
  networking requirements.

## User Stories

*Story 1: Fast virtualized network functions*

A user asks for a "fast network" and automatically gets all the various
pieces coordinated (hugepages, cpusets, network device) co-located on a
socket.

*Story 2: Accelerated neural network training*

A user asks for an accelerator device and some number of exclusive CPUs
in order to get the best training performance, due to socket-alignment of
the assigned CPUs and devices.

# Proposal

*Main idea: Two phase topology coherence protocol*

Topology affinity is tracked at the container level, similar to devices and
CPU affinity. At pod admission time, a new component called the Topology
Manager collects possible configurations from the Device Manager and the
CPU Manager. The Topology Manager acts as an oracle for local alignment by
those same components when they make concrete resource allocations. We
expect the consulted components to use the inferred QoS class of each
pod in order to prioritize the importance of fulfilling optimal locality.

## Proposed Changes

### New Component: Topology Manager

This proposal is focused on a new component in the Kubelet called the
Topology Manager. The Topology Manager implements the pod admit handler
interface and participates in Kubelet pod admission. When the `Admit()`
function is called, the Topology Manager collects topology hints from other
Kubelet components.

If the hints are not compatible, the Topology Manager may choose to
reject the pod. Behavior in this case depends on a new Kubelet configuration
value to choose the topology policy. The Topology Manager supports two
modes: `strict` and `preferred` (default). In `strict` mode, the pod is
rejected if alignment cannot be satisfied. The Topology Manager could
use `softAdmitHandler` to keep the pod in `Pending` state.

The Topology Manager component will be disabled behind a feature gate until
graduation from alpha to beta.

#### Computing Preferred Affinity

A topology hint indicates a preference for some well-known local resources.
Initially, the only supported reference resource is a mask of CPU socket IDs.
After collecting hints from all providers, the Topology Manager chooses some
mask that is present in all lists. Here is a sketch:

1. Apply a partial order on each list: number of bits set in the
   mask, ascending. This biases the result to be more precise if
   possible.
1. Iterate over the permutations of preference lists and compute
   bitwise-and over the masks in each permutation.
1. Store the first non-empty result and break out early.
1. If no non-empty result exists, return an error.

The behavior when a match does not exist is configurable, as described
above.

#### New Interfaces

```go
package topologymanager

// TopologyManager helps to coordinate local resource alignment
// within the Kubelet.
type Manager interface {
  lifecycle.PodAdmitHandler
  Store
  AddHintProvider(HintProvider)
  RemovePod(podName string)
}

// SocketMask is a bitmask-like type denoting a subset of available sockets.
type SocketMask struct{} // TBD

// TopologyHints encodes locality to local resources.
type TopologyHints struct {
  Sockets []SocketMask
}

// HintStore manages state related to the Topology Manager.
type Store interface {
  // GetAffinity returns the preferred affinity for the supplied
  // pod and container.
  GetAffinity(podName string, containerName string) TopologyHints
}

// HintProvider is implemented by Kubelet components that make
// topology-related resource assignments. The Topology Manager consults each
// hint provider at pod admission time.
type HintProvider interface {
  // Returns hints if this hint provider has a preference; otherwise
  // returns `_, false` to indicate "don't care".
  GetTopologyHints(pod v1.Pod, containerName string) (TopologyHints, bool)
}
```

### Feature Gate and Kubelet Flags
 
A new feature gate will be added to enable the Topology Manager feature. This feature gate will be enabled in Kubelet, and will be disabled by default in the Alpha release.  

 * Proposed Feature Gate:  
  `--feature-gate=TopologyManager=true`  
 
 This will be also followed by a Kubelet Flag for the Topology Manager Policy, which is described above. The `preferred` policy will be the default policy.
 
 * Proposed Policy Flag:  
 `--topology-manager-policy=preferred|strict`  
 
### Changes to Existing Components

1. Kubelet consults Topology Manager for pod admission (discussed above.)
1. Add two implementations of Topology Manager interface and a feature gate.
    1. As much Topology Manager functionality as possible is stubbed when the
       feature gate is disabled.
    1. Add a functional Topology Manager that queries hint providers in order
       to compute a preferred socket mask for each container.
1. Add `GetTopologyHints()` method to CPU Manager.
    1. CPU Manager static policy calls `GetAffinity()` method of
       Topology Manager when deciding CPU affinity.
1. Add `GetTopologyHints()` method to Device Manager.
    1. Add Socket ID to Device structure in the device plugin
       interface. Plugins should be able to determine the socket
       when enumerating supported devices. See the protocol diff below.
    1. Device Manager calls `GetAffinity()` method of Topology Manager when
       deciding device allocation.
