## Summary

This proposal adds IPv4/IPv6 dual stack functionality to Kubernetes clusters. This includes the following concepts:
- Awareness of multiple IPv4/IPv6 address assignments per pod
- Native IPv4-to-IPv4 in parallel with IPv6-to-IPv6 communications to, from, and within a cluster

## Motivation

The adoption of IPv6 has increased in recent years, and customers are requesting IPv6 support in Kubernetes clusters. To this end, the support of IPv6-only clusters was added as an alpha feature in Kubernetes Version 1.9. Clusters can now be run in either IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or in a "single-pod-IP-aware" dual-stack configuration. This "single-pod-IP-aware" dual-stack support is limited by the following restrictions:
- Some CNI network plugins are capable of assigning dual-stack addresses on a pod, but Kubernetes is aware of only one address per pod.
- Kubernetes system pods (api server, controller manager, etc.) can have only one IP address per pod, and system pod addresses are either all IPv4 or all IPv6.
- Endpoints for services are either all IPv4 or all IPv6 within a cluster.
- Service IPs are either all IPv4 or all IPv6 within a cluster.

For scenarios that require legacy IPv4-only clients or services (either internal or external to the cluster), the above restrictions mean that complex and expensive IPv4/IPv6 transition mechanisms (e.g. NAT64/DNS64, stateless NAT46, or SIIT/MAP) will need to be implemented in the data center networking.

One alternative to adding transition mechanisms would be to modify Kubernetes to provide support for IPv4 and IPv6 communications in parallel, for both pods and services, throughout the cluster (a.k.a. "full" dual stack).

A second, simpler alternative, which is a variation to the "full" dual stack model, would be to provide dual stack addresses for pods and nodes, but restrict service IPs to be single-family (i.e. allocated from a single service CIDR). In this case, service IPs in a cluster would be either all IPv4 or all IPv6, as they are now. Compared to a full dual-stack approach, this "dual-stack pods / single-family services" approach saves on implementation complexity, but would introduce some minor feature restrictions. (For more details on these tradeoffs, please refer to the "Variation: Dual-Stack Service CIDRs" section under "Alternatives" below).

This proposal aims to add "dual-stack pods / single-family services" support to Kubernetes clusters, providing native IPv4-to-IPv4 communication and native IPv6-to-IPv6 communication to, from and within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Goals

- Pod Connectivity: IPv4-to-IPv4 and IPv6-to-IPv6 access between pods
- Access to External Servers: IPv4-to-IPv4 and IPv6-to-IPv6 access from pods to external servers
- NGINX Ingress Controller Access: Access from IPv4 and/or IPv6 external clients to Kubernetes services via the Kubernetes NGINX Ingress Controller.
- Dual-stack support for Kubernetes service NodePorts and ExternalIPs
- Functionality tested with the Bridge CNI plugin, PTP CNI plugin, and Host-Local IPAM plugins as references
- Maintain backwards-compatible support for IPv4-only and IPv6-only clusters

### Non-Goals

- Service CIDRs: Dual-stack service CIDRs will not be supported for this proposal. Service access within a cluster will be done via all IPv4 service IPs or all IPv6 service IPs.
- Single-Family Applications: There may be some some clients or applications that only work with (bind to) IPv4 or or only work with (bind to) IPv6. A cluster can support either IPv4-only applications or IPv6-only applications (not both), depending upon the cluster CIDR's IP family. For example, if a cluster uses an IPv6 service CIDR, then IPv6-only applications will work fine, but IPv4-only applications in that cluster will not have IPv4 service IPs (and corresponding DNS A records) with which to access Kubernetes services. If a cluster needs to support legacy IPv4-only applications, but not IPv6-only applications, then the cluster should be configured with an IPv4 service CIDR.
- Cross-family connectivity: IPv4-to-IPv6 and IPv6-to-IPv4 connectivity is considered outside of the scope of this proposal. (As a possible future enhancement, the Kubernetes NGINX ingress controller could be modified to load balance to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for each endpoint. With such a change, it's possible that an external IPv4 client could access a Kubernetes service via an IPv6 pod address, and vice versa).
- CNI network plugins: Some plugins other than the Bridge, PTP, and Host-Local IPAM plugins may support Kubernetes dual stack, but the development and testing of dual stack support for these other plugins is considered outside of the scope of this proposal.
- Multiple IPs vs. Dual-Stack: Code changes will be done in a way to facilitate future expansion to more general multiple-IPs-per-pod and multiple-IPs-per-node support. However, this initial release will impose "dual-stack-centric" IP address limits as follows:
  - Pod addresses: 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 addresses per pod maximum
  - Node addresses: 1 IPv4 address and 1 IPv6 addresses per node maximum
  - Service addresses: 1 service IP address per service
- Kube-DNS is expected to be End-of-Life soon, so dual-stack testing will be performed using coreDNS.
- External load balancers that rely on Kubernetes services for load balancing functionality will only work with the IP family that matches the IP family of the cluster's service CIDR.
- Dual-stack support for Kubernetes orchestration tools other than kubeadm (e.g. miniKube, KubeSpray, etc.) are considered outside of the scope of this proposal. Communication about how to enable dual-stack functionality will be documented appropriately in-order so that aformentioned tools may choose to enable it for use.

## Proposal

In order to support dual-stack in Kubernetes clusters, Kubernetes needs to have awareness of and support dual-stack addresses for pods and nodes. Here is a summary of the proposal (details follow in subsequent sections):

- Kubernetes needs to be made aware of multiple IPs per pod (limited to one IPv4 and one IPv6 address per pod maximum).
- Link Local Addresses (LLAs) on a pod will remain implicit (Kubernetes will not display nor track these addresses).
- For simplicity, only a single family of service IPs per cluster will be supported (i.e. service IPs are either all IPv4 or all IPv6).
- Backend pods for a service can be dual stack.
- Endpoints for a dual-stack backend pod will be represented as a dual-stack address pair (i.e. 1 IPv4/IPv6 endpoint per backend pod, rather than 2 single-family endpoints per backend pod)
- Kube-proxy iptables mode needs to drive iptables and ip6tables in parallel. This is required, even though service IP support is single-family, so that Kubernetes services can be exposed to clients external to the cluster via both IPv4 and IPv6. Support includes:
  - Service IPs: Single family support (either all IPv4 or all IPv6 service IPs in a cluster)
  - NodePort: Support listening on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
  - ExternalIPs: Can be IPv4 or IPv6
- Kube-proxy IPVS mode will support dual-stack functionality similar to kube-proxy iptables mode as described above. IPVS kube-router support for dual stack, on the other hand, is considered outside of the scope of this proposal.
- For health/liveness/readiness probe support, the default behavior will not change and an additional optional field would be added to the pod specification and is respected by kubelet. This will allow application developers to select a preferred IP family to use for implementing probes on dual-stack pods.
- The pod status API changes will include a per-IP string map for arbitrary annotations, as a placeholder for future Kubernetes enhancements. This mapping is not required for this dual-stack design, but will allow future annotations, e.g. allowing a CNI network plugin to indicate to which network a given IP address applies. The approriate hooks will be provided to enable CRI/CNI to provide these details.
- Kubectl commands and output displays will need to be modified for dual-stack.
- Kubeadm support will need to be added to enable spin-up of dual-stack clusters. Kubeadm support is required for implementing dual-stack continuous integration (CI) tests.
- New e2e test cases will need to be added to test parallel IPv4/IPv6 connectivity between pods, nodes, and services.

### Implementation Plan

Given the scope of this enhancement, it has been suggested that we break the implementation into descrete phases that may be spread out over the span of many release cycles. The phases are as follows:

Phase 1
- API type modifications
   - Kubernetes types
   - CRI types
- dual-stack pod networking (multi-IP pod)
- kubenet multi-family support

Phase 2
- Multi-family services including kube-proxy
- Working with a CNI provider to enable dual-stack support
- Change kubelet prober to support multi-address
- Update component flags to support multiple `--bind-address`


- External dependencies, eg. cloud-provide, CNI, CRI, CoreDNS etc...

### Awareness of Multiple IPs per Pod

Since Kubernetes Version 1.9, Kubernetes users have had the capability to use dual-stack-capable CNI network plugins (e.g. Bridge + Host Local, Calico, etc.), using the 
[0.3.1 version of the CNI Networking Plugin API](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/spec-v0.3.1/SPEC.md), to configure multiple IPv4/IPv6 addresses on pods. However, Kubernetes currently captures and uses only IP address from the pod's main interface.

This proposal aims to extend the Kubernetes Pod Status and the Pod Network Status API so that Kubernetes can track and make use of one or many IPv4 addresses and one or many IPv6 address assignment per pod.

CNI provides list of ips and their versions. Kubernetes currently just chooses to ignore this and use a single IP. This means this struct will need to follow the pod.Pod ip style of primary IP as is, and another slice of IPs, having Pod.IPs[0] == Pod.IP which will look like the following:

    type PodNetworkStatus struct {
      metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`

      // IP is the primary ipv4/ipv6 address of the pod. Among other things it is the address that -
      //   - kube expects to be reachable across the cluster
      //   - service endpoints are constructed with
      //   - will be reported in the PodStatus.PodIP field (will override the IP reported by docker)
      IP net.IP `json:"ip" description:"Primary IP address of the pod"`
            IPs  []net.IP `json:"ips" description:"list of ips"`
    }

CNI as of today does not provide additional metadata to the IP. So this Properties field - speced in this KEP - will be empty until CNI spec includes properties. Although in theory we can copy the interface name, gateway etc. into this Properties map.

### Required changes to Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

The PLEG loop + status manager of kubelet makes an extensive use of PodSandboxStatus call to wire up PodIP to api server, as a patch call to Pod Resources. The problem with this is the response message wraps PodSandboxNetworkStatus struct and this struct only carries one IP. This will require a change similar to the change described above. We will work with the CRI team to coordinate this change.

    type PodSandboxNetworkStatus struct {
      // IP address of the PodSandbox.
      Ip string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ip,proto3" json:"ip,omitempty"`
            Ips []string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ip,proto3" json:"ip,omitempty"`
    }

#### Versioned API Change: PodStatus v1 core
In order to maintain backwards compatibility for the core V1 API, this proposal retains the existing (singular) "PodIP" field in the core V1 version of the [PodStatus V1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#podstatus-v1-core), and adds a new array of structures that store pod IPs along with associated metadata for that IP. The metadata for each IP (refer to the "Properties" map below) will not be used by the dual-stack feature, but is added as a placeholder for future enhancements, e.g. to allow CNI network plugins to indicate to which physical network that an IP is associated. Retaining the existing "PodIP" field for backwards compatibility is in accordance with the [Kubernetes API change quidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md).
```
    // Default IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the
    // cluster. Empty if not yet allocated.
    PodIP string `json:"podIP,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=podIP"`

    // IP address information for entries in the (plural) PodIPs slice.
    // Each entry includes:
    //    IP: An IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within
    //        the cluster.
    //    Properties: Arbitrary metadata associated with the allocated IP.
    type PodIPInfo struct {
        IP string
        Properties map[string]string
    }

    // IP addresses allocated to the pod with associated metadata. This list
    // is inclusive, i.e. it includes the default IP address stored in the
    // "PodIP" field, and this default IP address must be recorded in the
    // 0th entry (PodIPs[0]) of the slice. The list is empty if no IPs have
    // been allocated yet.
    PodIPs []PodIPInfo `json:"podIPs,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=podIPs"`
```

##### Default Pod IP Selection
Older servers and clients that were built before the introduction of full dual stack will only be aware of and make use of the original, singular PodIP field above. It is therefore considered to be the default IP address for the pod. When the PodIP and PodIPs fields are populated, the PodIPs[0] field must match the (default) PodIP entry. If a pod has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses allocated, then the IP address chosen as the default IP address will match the IP family of the cluster's configured service CIDR. For example, if the service CIDR is IPv4, then the IPv4 address will be used as the default address.

#### PodStatus Internal Representation
The PodStatus internal representation will be modified to use a slice of PodIPInfo structs rather than a singular IP ("PodIP"):
```
    // IP address information. Each entry includes:
    //    IP: An IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within
    //        the cluster.
    //    Properties: Arbitrary metadata associated with the allocated IP.
    // Empty if no IPs have been allocated yet.
    type PodIPInfo struct {
        IP string
        Properties map[string]string
    }

    // IP addresses allocated to the pod with associated metadata.
    PodIPs []PodIPInfo `json:"podIPs,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=podIPs"`
```
This internal representation should eventually become part of a versioned API (after a period of deprecation for the singular "PodIP" field).

#### Maintaining Compatible Interworking between Old and New Clients
Any Kubernetes API change needs to consider consistent interworking between a possible mix of clients that are running old vs. new versions of the API. In this particular case, however, there is only ever one writer of the PodStatus object, and it is the API server itself. Therefore, the API server does not have an absolute requirement to implement any safeguards and/or fixups between the singular PodIP and the plural PodIPs fields as described in the guidelines for pluralizing singular API fields that is included in the [Kubernetes API change quidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md).

However, as a defensive coding measure and for future-proofing, the following API version translation logic will be implemented for the PodIP/PodIPs fields:

##### V1 to Core (Internal) Conversion
- If only V1 PodIP is provided:
  - Copy V1 PodIP to core PodIPs[0]
- Else if only V1 PodIPs[] is provided: # Undetermined as to whether this can actually happen (@thockin)
  - Copy V1 PodIPs[] to core PodIPs[]
- Else if both V1 PodIP and V1 PodIPs[] are provided:
  - Verify that V1 PodIP matches V1 PodIPs[0]
  - Copy V1 PodIPs[] to core PodIPs[]
- Delete any duplicates in core PodIPs[]

##### Core (Internal) to V1 Conversion
  - Copy core PodIPs[0] to V1 PodIP
  - Copy core PodIPs[] to V1 PodIPs[]

### Awareness of Multiple NodeCIDRs per Node
As with PodIP, corresponding changes will need to be made to NodeCIDR. These changes are essentially the same as the aformentioned PodIP changes which create the pularalization of NodeCIDRs to a slice rather than a singular and making those changes across the internal representation and v1 with associated conversations.


#### kubelet Startup Configuration for Dual-Stack Pod CIDRs
The existing "--pod-cidr" option for the [kubelet startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) will be modified to support multiple IP CIDRs in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP string), i.e.:
```
  --pod-cidr  ipNetSlice   [IP CIDRs, comma separated list of CIDRs, Default: []]
```
Only the first address of each IP family will be used; all others will be logged and ignored.

#### kube-proxy Startup Configuration for Dual-Stack Pod CIDRs
The existing "cluster-cidr" option for the [kube-proxy startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) will be modified to support multiple cluster CIDRs in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP string), i.e:
```
  --cluster-cidr  ipNetSlice   [IP CIDRs, comma separated list of CIDRs, Default: []]
```
Only the first address of each IP family will be used; all others will be logged and ignored.

#### 'kubectl get pods -o wide' Command Display for Dual-Stack Pod Addresses
The output for the 'kubectl get pods -o wide' command will need to be modified to display a comma-separated list of IPs for each pod, e.g.:
```
       kube-master# kubectl get pods -o wide
       NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP                          NODE
       nginx-controller   1/1       Running   0          20m       fd00:db8:1::2,192.168.1.3   kube-minion-1
       kube-master#
```

#### 'kubectl describe pod ...' Command Display for Dual-Stack Pod Addresses
The output for the 'kubectl describe pod ...' command will need to be modified to display a comma-separated list of IPs for each pod, e.g.:
```
       kube-master# kubectl describe pod nginx-controller
       .
       .
       .
       IPs:     fd00:db8:1::2,192.168.1.3
       .
       .
       .
```

### Container Networking Interface (CNI) Plugin Considerations

This feature requires the use of the [CNI Networking Plugin API version 0.3.1](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/spec-v0.3.1/SPEC.md)
or later. The dual-stack feature requires no changes to this API.

The versions of CNI plugin binaries that must be used for proper dual-stack functionality (and IPv6 functionality in general) depend upon the version of Docker that is used in the cluster nodes (see [CNI issue #531](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/issues/531) and [CNI plugins PR #113](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/113)):
- Docker versions 17.03 or older require CNI plugin binaries version 0.6.0 or newer
- Docker versions newer than 17.03 require CNI plugin binaries that are Version 0.7.0 or newer.

### Endpoints

The current [Kubernetes Endpoints API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpoints-v1-core) (i.e. before the addition of the dual stack feature), supports only a single IP address per endpoint. With the addition of the dual stack feature, pods serving as backends for Kubernetes services may now have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This presents a design choice of how to represent such dual-stack endpoints in the Endpoints API. Two choices worth considering would be:
- 2 single-family endpoints per backend pod: Make no change to the [Kubernetes Endpoints API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpoints-v1-core). Treat each IPv4/IPv6 address as separate, distinct endpoints, and include each address in the comma-separated list of addresses in an 'Endpoints' API object.
- 1 dual-stack endpoint per backend pod: Modify the [Kubernetes Endpoints API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpoints-v1-core) so that each endpoint can be associated with a pair of IPv4/IPv6 addresses.

Although the first approach would be simpler and quicker to implement, providing two endpoints per backend pod would be problematic for the following ways in which endpoints are used in Kubernetes:
- Distributed applications use endpoints for peer discovery.
- Monitoring systems such as Prometheus use endpoints to identify monitoring targets.
- Users use endpoints to determine how many instances are up.

In order to avoid breaking the above uses of the Endpoints API, this design proposes modifying the [Kubernetes EndpointAddress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpointaddress-v1-core) to support inclusion of both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address to be associated with a given endpoint.

Note that this proposed change retains the singular sense of the API object name "EndpointAddress", even though the object may contain a pair of IPv4/IPv6 addresses. This can be considered a tradeoff in design simplification over clarity. The alternative would be to create a new API object called "EndpointAddresses" (similar to the "EndpointAddress" object, but with multiple IP addresses), and then modify the [Kubernetes EndpointSubset API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpointsubset-v1-core) to include both the existing "EndpointAddress" object and a new "EndpointAddresses" object (for backwards compatibility).

#### Versioned API Change: EndpointAddress v1 core
In order to maintain backwards compatibility for the core V1 API, this proposal retains the existing (singular) "IP" field in the core V1 version of the [Kubernetes EndpointAddress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpointaddress-v1-core), and adds a new slice of strings called "IPs" for recording multiple IPs associated with an endpoint:
```
// EndpointAddress is a tuple that describes one or more IP addresses for an
// endpoint.
 type EndpointAddress struct {
     // The default IP for this endpoint.
     IP string `json:"ip" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ip"`
     // The IPs for this endpoint. The zeroth element (IPs[0] must match
     // the default value set in the IP field)
     IPs []string `json:"ips" protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=ips"`
     // The Hostname of this endpoint
     // +optional
     Hostname string `json:"hostname,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=hostname"`
     // Optional: Node hosting this endpoint. This can be used to determine endpoints local to a node.
     // +optional
     NodeName *string `json:"nodeName,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=nodeName"`
     // Reference to object providing the endpoint.
     // +optional
     TargetRef *ObjectReference `json:"targetRef,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=targetRef"`
 }
```

##### Default Endpoint IP Selection
Older servers and clients that were built before the introduction of full dual stack will only be aware of and make use of the original, singular IP field above. It is therefore considered to be the default IP address for the endpoint. When the IP and IPs fields are populated, the IPs[0] field must match the (default) IP entry. If a pod has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses allocated, then the IP address chosen as the default IP address will match the IP family of the cluster's configured service CIDR. For example, if the service CIDR is IPv4, then the IPv4 address will be used as the default endpoint address.

#### EndpointAddress Internal Representation
The EndpointAddress internal representation will be modified to use a slice of IP strings ("IPs") rather than a singular IP strings ("IP"):
```
// EndpointAddress is a tuple that describes one or more IP addresses for an
// endpoint.
type EndpointAddress struct {
	// The IPs for this endpoint.
	IPs []string
	// Optional: Hostname of this endpoint
	// Meant to be used by DNS servers etc.
	// +optional
	Hostname string
	// Optional: Node hosting this endpoint. This can be used to determine endpoints local to a node.
	// +optional
	NodeName *string
	// Optional: The kubernetes object related to the entry point.
	TargetRef *ObjectReference
}
```
This internal representation should eventually become part of a versioned API (after a period of deprecation for the singular "IP" field).

#### Maintaining Compatible Interworking between Old and New Clients
With this API change, we need to consider the scenario where there are a mix of clients that are running old vs. new versions of the API. The old clients would only be aware of the original, singular IP field, whereas newer clients could be writing either just the plural IPs field, or updating both singular IP and plural IPs fields. To cover this case, the API server will need to implement some safeguards/fix-ups for these fields for write operations (in compliance with the guidelines for pluralizing singular API fields that is included in the [Kubernetes API change quidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api_changes.md):

##### V1 to Core (Internal) Conversion
- If only V1 IP is provided:
  - Copy V1 IP to core IPs[0]
- Else if only V1 IPs[] is provided:
  - Copy V1 IPs[] to core IPs[]
- Else if both V1 IP and V1 IPs[] are provided:
  - Verify that V1 IP matches V1 IPs[0]
  - Copy V1 IPs[] to core IPs[]
- Delete any duplicates in core IPs[]

##### Core (Internal) to V1 Conversion
  - Copy core IPs[0] to V1 IP
  - Copy core IPs[] to V1 IPs[]


#### Configuration of Endpoint IP Family in Service Definitions
This proposal adds an option to configure an endpoint IP family for a Kubernetes service:
```
    endpointFamily: <ipv4|ipv6|dual-stack>       [Default: dual-stack]
```
For example, the spec definition for an application that only binds to IPv4 might look like this:
```
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
  endpointFamily: ipv4
```
This per-service endpoint IP family configuration is required for IPv4-only and IPv6-only Application Support. For example, if there is a legacy application that only binds to IPv4 addresses (IPv4-only application) that is running in an otherwise dual-stack cluster, then we don't want endpoints for the service to include IPv6 addresses that are allocated to backend pods for the service. Otherwise, any IPv6 addresses that are included in endpoints would be "dead ends" (no response will be received from the server) for ingress controller and external load balancer operation. The same reasoning applies to IPv6-only applications.

If a service is configured for an endpointFamily of "ipv4" ("ipv6"), then endpoints for that port for the service will not include any IPv6 (IPv4) addresses that have been allocated to backend pods for the service.

If a service is configured with an endpointFamily of "dual-stack", then both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints will be created, but the service will only have a single service IP allocated (with a family that matches the cluster's configured service CIDR).

If a service is exposed via nodePort, and the service is configured with an endpointFamily of "dual-stack", then iptables will be configured for both families, allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.

#### Modifying Consumers of EndpointAddress API to Use Dual-Stack Addresses
Any clients that consume the [Kubernetes EndpointAddress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#endpointaddress-v1-core) will need to be modified to read the new plural IPs field, if they are to take advantage of the dual-stack feature. This proposal will include dual-stack updates to the following consumers of Kubernetes endpoints:
- kube-proxy, iptables mode
- kube-proxy, IPVS mode
- Nginx Ingress controller
Other users/consumers of this API may be updated to dual-stack over time, but that work is considered outside of the scope of this proposal.

#### 'kubectl get endpoints' Command Display for Dual-Stack Backend Pods
The 'kubectl get endpoints ...' command display should be changed so that:
- IPv4/IPv6 endpoint address pairs appear within curly braces.
- If dual-stack endpoint address pairs are present, then each pair should be printed on its own line as show below.
Example:
```
       kube-master# kubectl get endpoints
       NAME            ENDPOINTS                             AGE
       kubernetes      {[fd00::100]:6443,10.0.0.2:6643}      15m
       nginx-service   {[fd00:db8:1::2]:80,192.168.1.3:80}   20m
                       {[fd00:db8:2::2]:80,192.168.2.3:80}   20m
       kube-master#
```

#### 'kubectl describe service' Command Display for Dual-Stack Backend Pods
The 'kubectl describe service ...' command display should be changed so that:
- IPv4/IPv6 endpoint address pairs appear within curly braces.
- If dual-stack endpoint address pairs are present, then each pair should be printed on its own line as show below.
Example:
```
       kube-master# kubectl describe service nginx-service
       .
       .
       .
       Endpoints:   {[fd00:db8:1::2]:80,192.168.1.3:80}
                    {[fd00:db8:2::2]:80,192.168.2.3:80}
       .
       .
       .
       kube-master#
```

### kube-proxy Operation

Kube-proxy will be modified to drive iptables and ip6tables in parallel. This will require the implementation of a second "proxier" interface in the Kube-Proxy server in order to modify and track changes to both tables. This is required in order to allow exposing services via both IPv4 and IPv6, e.g. using Kubernetes:
  - NodePort
  - ExternalIPs

#### Kube-Proxy Startup Configuration Changes

##### Multiple bind addresses configuration
The existing "--bind-address" option for the [kube-proxy startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) will be modified to support multiple IP addresses in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP string).
```
  --bind-address  stringSlice   (IP addresses, in a comma separated list, Default: [0.0.0.0,])
```
Only the first address of each IP family will be used; all others will be ignored.

##### Multiple cluster CIDRs configuration
The existing "--cluster-cidr" option for the [kube-proxy startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) will be modified to support multiple IP CIDRs in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP CIDR).
A new [kube-proxy configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) argument will be added to allow a user to specify multiple cluster CIDRs.
```
  --cluster-cidr  ipNetSlice   (IP CIDRs, in a comma separated list, Default: [])
```
Only the first CIDR for each IP family will be used; all others will be ignored.

### CoreDNS Operation

CoreDNS will need to make changes in order to support the plural form of endpoint addresses. Some other considerations of CoreDNS support for dual stack:

- Because service IPs will remain single-family, pods will continue to access the CoreDNS server via a single service IP. In other words, the nameserver entries in a pod's /etc/resolv.conf will typically be a single IPv4 or single IPv6 address, depending upon the IP family of the cluster's service CIDR.
- Non-headless Kubernetes services: CoreDNS will resolve these services to either an IPv4 entry (A record) or an IPv6 entry (AAAA record), depending upon the IP family of the cluster's service CIDR.
- Headless Kubernetes services: CoreDNS will resolve these services to either an IPv4 entry (A record), an IPv6 entry (AAAA record), or both, depending on the service's endpointFamily configuration (see [Configuration of Endpoint IP Family in Service Definitions](#configuration-of-endpoint-ip-family-in-service-definitions)).

### Ingress Controller Operation

The [Kubernetes ingress feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) relies on the use of an ingress controller. The two "reference" ingress controllers that are considered here are the [GCE ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce/blob/master/README.md#glbc) and the [NGINX ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/README.md#nginx-ingress-controller).

#### GCE Ingress Controller: Out-of-Scope, Testing Deferred For Now
It is not clear whether the [GCE ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce/blob/master/README.md#glbc) supports external, dual-stack access. Testing of dual-stack access to Kubernetes services via a GCE ingress controller is considered out-of-scope until after the initial implementation of dual-stack support for Kubernetes.

#### NGINX Ingress Controller - Dual-Stack Support for Bare Metal Clusters
The [NGINX ingress controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/README.md#nginx-ingress-controller) should provide dual-stack external access to Kubernetes services that are hosted on baremetal clusters, with little or no changes.

- Dual-stack external access to NGINX ingress controllers is not supported with GCE/GKE or AWS cloud platforms.
- NGINX ingress controller needs to be run on a pod with dual-stack external access.
- On the load balancer (internal) side of the NGINX ingress controller, the controller will load balance to backend service pods on a per dual-stack-endpoint basis, rather than load balancing on a per-address basis. For example, if a given backend pod has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address, the ingress controller will treat the IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints as a single load-balance target. Support of dual-stack endpoints may require upstream changes to the NGINX ingress controller.
- Ingress access can cross IP families. For example, an incoming L7 request that is received via IPv4 can be load balanced to an IPv6 endpoint address in the cluster, and vice versa. 

### Load Balancer Operation

As noted above, External load balancers that rely on Kubernetes services for load balancing functionality will only work with the IP family that matches the IP family of the cluster's service CIDR.

#### Type ClusterIP

The ClusterIP service type will be single stack, so for this case there will be no changes to the current load balancer config. The user has the option to create two load balancer IP resources, one for IPv6 and the other for IPv4, and associate both with the same application instances.

#### Type NodePort

The NodePort service type uses the nodes IP address, which can be dual stack, and port. If the service type is NodePort and the ipFamily is DualStack [NodePort](#configuration-of-ip-family-in-service-definitions) the load balancer can be configured as dual stack, as both families will get forwarded.

#### Type Load Balancer

The cloud provider will provision an external load balancer. If the cloud provider load balancer maps directly to the pod iP's then a dual stack load balancer could be used. Additional information may need to be provided to the cloud provider to configure dual stack. See Implementation Plan for further details.

### Cloud Provider Plugins Considerations

The [Cloud Providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/) may have individual requirements for dual stack in addition to below.

#### Multiple bind addresses configuration

The existing "--bind-address" option for the will be modified to support multiple IP addresses in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP string).
```
  --bind-address  stringSlice   (IP addresses, in a comma separated list, Default: [0.0.0.0,])
```
Only the first address of each IP family will be used; all others will be ignored.

#### Multiple cluster CIDRs configuration

The existing "--cluster-cidr" option for the [cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/cloud-controller-manager/) will be modified to support multiple IP CIDRs in a comma-separated list (rather than a single IP CIDR).
```
  --cluster-cidr  ipNetSlice   (IP CIDRs, in a comma separated list, Default: [])
```
Only the first CIDR for each IP family will be used; all others will be ignored.

The cloud_cidr_allocator will be updated to support allocating from multiple CIDRs. The route_controller will be updated to create routes for multiple CIDRs.

### Container Environment Variables

The [container environmental variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-environment-variables/#container-environment) should support dual stack.

Pod information is exposed through environmental variables on the pod. There are a few environmental variables that are automatically created, and some need to be specified in the pod definition, through the downward api.

The Downward API [status.podIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#capabilities-of-the-downward-api) will preserve the existing single IP address, and will be set to the default IP for each pod. A new environmental variable named status.podIPs will contain a space-separated list of IP addresses. The new pod API will have a slice of structures for the additional IP addresses. Kubelet will translate the pod structures and return podIPs as a comma-delimited string.

Here is an example of how to define a pluralized MY_POD_IPS environmental variable in a pod definition yaml file:
```
  - name: MY_POD_IPS
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.podIPs
  - name: MY_POD_IPS_PROPERTIES_0
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.podIPs[0].properties
```

This definition will cause an environmental variable setting in the pod similar to the following:
```
MY_POD_IPS=fd00:10:20:0:3::3,10.20.3.3
MY_POD_IPS_PROPERTIES_<IP_index>=x:y #We assume that colon is not going to used in map values.
```

### Kubeadm Support

Dual-stack support will need to be added to kubeadm both for dual-stack development purposes, and for use in dual-stack continuous integration tests.

- The Kubeadm config options and config file will support dual stack options for apiserver-advertise-address, and podSubnet.

#### Kubeadm Configuration Options

The kubeadm configuration options for advertiseAddress and podSubnet will need to be changed to handle a comma-separated list of CIDRs:
```
    api:
      advertiseAddress: "fd00:90::2,10.90.0.2" [Multiple IP CIDRs, comma separated list of CIDRs]
    networking:
      podSubnet: "fd00:10:20::/72,10.20.0.0/16" [Multiple IP CIDRs, comma separated list of CIDRs]
```

#### Kubeadm-Generated Manifests

Kubeadm will need to generate dual-stack CIDRs for the --service-cluster-ip-range command line argument in kube-apiserver.yaml:
```
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - kube-apiserver
        - --service-cluster-ip-range=fd00:1234::/110,10.96.0.0/12
```

Kubeadm will also need to generate dual-stack CIDRs for the --cluster-cidr argument in kube-apiserver.yaml:
```
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - kube-controller-manager
        - --cluster-cidr=fd00:10:20::/72,10.20.0.0/16
```

### vendor/github.com/spf13/pflag
This dual-stack proposal will introduce a new IPNetSlice object to spf13.pflag to allow parsing of comma separated CIDRs. Refer to [https://github.com/spf13/pflag/pull/170](https://github.com/spf13/pflag/pull/170)

### End-to-End Test Support
End-to-End tests will be updated for Dual Stack. The Dual Stack E2E tests will use deployment scripts from the kubernetes-sigs/kubeadm-dind-cluster github repo to set up a containerized, multi-node Kubernetes cluster that is running in a Prow container (Docker-in-Docker-in-Docker, or DinDinD configuration), similar to the IPv6-only E2E tests (see [test-infra PR # 7529](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/7529)). The DinDinD cluster will be updated to support dual-stack.

The E2E test suite that will be run for dual stack will be based upon the [IPv6-only test suite](https://github.com/CiscoSystems/kube-v6-test) as a baseline. New versions of the network connectivity test cases that are listed below will need to be created so that both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to and from a pod can be tested within the same test case. A new dual-stack test flag will be created to control when the dual stack tests are run versus single stack versions of the tests:
```
[It] should function for node-pod communication: udp [Conformance]
[It] should function for node-pod communication: http [Conformance]
[It] should function for intra-pod communication: http [Conformance]
[It] should function for intra-pod communication: udp [Conformance]
```
Most service test cases do not need to be updated as the service remains single stack.

For the test that checks pod internet connectivity, the IPv4 and IPv6 tests can be run individually, with the same initial configurations.
```
[It] should provide Internet connection for containers
```

## Alternatives

### Dual Stack at the Edge
Instead of modifying Kubernetes to provide dual-stack functionality within the cluster, one alternative is to run a cluster in IPv6-only mode, and instantiate IPv4-to-IPv6 translation mechanisms at the edge of the cluster. Such an approach can be called "Dual Stack at the Edge". Since the translation mechanisms are mostly external to the cluster, very little changes (or integration) would be required to the Kubernetes cluster itself. (This may be quicker for Kubernetes users to implement than waiting for the changes proposed in this proposal to be implemented).

For example, a cluster administrator could configure a Kubernetes cluster in IPv6-only mode, and then instantiate the following external to the cluster:
- Stateful NAT64 and DNS64 servers: These would handle connections from IPv6 pods to external IPv4-only servers. The NAT64/DNS64 servers would be in the data center, but functionally external to the cluster. (Although one variation to consider would be to implement the DNS64 server inside the cluster as a CoreDNS plugin.)
- Dual-stack ingress controllers (e.g. Nginx): The ingress controller would need dual-stack access on the external side, but would load balance to IPv6-only endpoints inside the cluster.
- Stateless NAT46 servers: For access from IPv4-only, external clients to Kubernetes pods, or to exposed services (e.g. via NodePort or ExternalIPs). This may require some static configuration for IPv4-to-IPv6 mappings.

### Variation: Dual-Stack Service CIDRs (a.k.a. Full Dual Stack)

As a variation to the "Dual-Stack Pods / Single-Family Services" approach outlined above, we can consider supporting IPv4 and IPv6 service CIDRs in parallel (a.k.a. the "full" dual stack approach).

#### Benefits
Providing dual-stack service CIDRs would add the following functionality:
- Dual-Stack Pod-to-Services. Clients would have a choice of using A or AAAA DNS records when resolving Kubernetes services.
- Simultaneous support for both IPv4-only and IPv6-only applications internal to the cluster. Without dual-stack service CIDRs, a cluster can support either IPv4-only applications or IPv6-only applications, depending upon the cluster CIDR's IP family. For example, if a cluster uses an IPv6 service CIDR, then IPv4-only applications in that cluster will not have IPv4 service IPs (and corresponding DNS A records) with which to access Kubernetes services.
- External load balancers that use Kubernetes services for load balancing functionality (i.e. by mapping to service IPs) would work in dual stack mode. (Without dual-stack service CIDRs, these external load balancers would only work for the IP family that matches the cluster service CIDR's family.)

#### Changes Required
- [controller-manager startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/): The "--service-cluster-ip-range" startup argument would need to be modified to accept a comma-separated list of CIDRs.
- [kube-apiserver startup configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/): The "--service-cluster-ip-range" would need to be modified to accept a comma-separated list of CIDRs.
- [Service V1 core API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#service-v1-core): This versioned API object would need to be modified to support multiple cluster IPs for each service. This would require, for example, the addition of an "ExtraClusterIPs" slice of strings, and the designation of one of the cluster IPs as the default cluster IP for a given service (similar to changes described above for the PodStatus v1 core API).
- The service allocator: This would need to be modified to allocate a service IP from each service CIDR for each service that is created.
- 'kubectl get service' command: The display output for this command would need to be modified to return multiple service IPs for each service.
- CoreDNS may need to be modified to loop through both (IPv4 and IPv6) service IPs for each given Kubernetes service, and advertise both IPs as A and AAAA records accordingly in DNS responses.
